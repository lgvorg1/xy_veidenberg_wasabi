# Here be plugins...

This is the default folder where Pline looks for the interface plugins - folders with a `plugin.json` file.
You can find some plugins from the [plugins repository](https://github.com/veidenberg/plugins) or craft your own interfaces with the help of the [API documentation](http://wasabiapp.org/pline/guide/api.html). The location of the plugins folder can be changed in the `server_settings.conf` file.
